                   Modular home design can really be summed up in just two words: “Infinite Possibility.” There’s no home that can be built that can’t be built with modular construction. Prefabs are no longer confined to just single story or even two story buildings, there’s no “average” modular floor plan, and anyone who says a modular home is less well-built than their site-built counterparts clearly hasn’t opened their eyes in the past 15 years.”

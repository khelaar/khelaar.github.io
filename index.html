                Modular home design can really be summed up in just two words: “Infinite Possibility.” There’s no home that can be built that can’t be built with modular construction. Prefabs are no longer confined to just single story or even two story buildings, there’s no “average” modular floor plan, and anyone who says a modular home is less well-built than their site-built counterparts clearly hasn’t opened their eyes in the past 15 years.”

            <p><strong>Insulate to Stay Cool:</strong> Solar modular homes are inherently more energy efficient than site-built homes. We envision better houses built with good insulation to help you stay cool. Insulation can be installed to stop the flow of heat so you can stay cool in hot weather, save energy and spend much less on utility bills, diesel, etc.

            <p><strong>A modular home</strong> is constructed from two or more factory-made boxes that are fitted together on site to create a safe, energy-efficient, and cost-effective home. These boxes are called “modules,” hence the name modular home. It is a type of prefabricated housing that has become increasingly popular in recent years since new technologies have allowed for this previously restrictive way of building to become 100% completely customizable.</p>
            <p>The modular housing industry is currently growing faster than any other type of new-home construction. This is because in general modular homes cost less, can be built faster, are more solid, and are even more environmentally friendly than standard site-built homes. Modular homes are not the same as manufactured or trailer homes. They are built to exceed the same building codes as traditional site-built homes and are subject to many more stages of inspection along the way to ensure the highest possible construction quality.</p>
            <p>Modular living is not just a simple and efficient way of constructing a home, there is increasing evidence that it is one of the greenest ways to build too. Whatever the size of a new modular home, you can build in features which will make your property energy efficient, and incorporate features which will cut your electricity bill drastically, or wipe it out altogether. Once a house is built, there’s virtually no visible difference between a modular home and a site-built home.

        <div class="column col-main">
            <p>The most obvious way of getting a green modular home is to incorporate <strong>solar panels</strong> on the roof of your property. They can either generate electricity which you run your heating from, or can heat water which can be used for showers or to heat radiators throughout the home. Even if you live in an area which does not enjoy many hours of sunshine each day, daylight can be enough to generate your electricity and keep your prefabricated home warm.

        <div class="column col-main">
            <p>No one method of energy efficiency in a modular home can reduce your heating bill to zero, but good quality insulation can go a long way to <strong>reducing costs.</strong> Most manufacturers who draw up modular home floor plans incorporate high standards of insulation on the walls, ceilings and have the best standard of windows and doors on the market. Good insulation can keep your house warm in winter, and cool in summer.</p>
            <p>Insulating to stay cool really only works if you air-seal first. Air sealing saves you money and keeps the cool air inside. Even if you have air-conditioning, be sure to upgrade your home insulation.  You’ll use the AC less, and if you’re getting a new air-conditioner, you’ll be able to downsize a smaller, less expensive system (with AC, bigger isn’t better!), and you’ll save twice, first on the cost of the smaller unit and then on the cost to run it.
